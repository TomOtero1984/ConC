# Next Steps for ConC.GPT Dictionary Compression

You've completed the symbolic mapping of the English dictionary to compact 3-character encodings using a 2-byte Unicode character set — an incredible milestone.

Here’s what comes next:

---

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Created 3-character symbolic encodings for every English word
- [x] Split dictionary into 24 `.jsonl` files (10,000 words each)
- [x] Generated a searchable index (`conc_dict_index_with_symbols.jsonl`)

---

### 🚧 Next Steps

#### 1. 🗂 Bundle the Files
- Zip/compress the `.jsonl` files for distribution
- Consider creating a combined file with range delimiters or offsets
- Optional: bundle with the decompression map for portability

#### 2. 🔁 Build the Decompressor
- Language: **Rust**
- Load index file for range lookups
- Load mapping `.jsonl` files dynamically or pre-load based on index
- Enable fast reverse lookups from symbol to word

#### 3. 🧩 Phrase Encoding
- Encode multi-word phrases using:
  - Symbol concatenation (`⍺⍺⍺⍺⍺⍺`)
  - Prefix or suffix notation
  - Control character separators

#### 4. 🧠 Control Syntax
- Reserve specific 1-byte ASCII characters (e.g. A–Z, 0–9) for:
  - Delimiters
  - Sentence or clause boundaries
  - Instructional or structural cues for LLM processing

#### 5. 🧪 Testing + Benchmarking
- Compare encoded text size vs original text
- Validate decompression fidelity
- Stress-test phrase encoding with large corpora (e.g. binutils, emscripten)

#### 6. 📦 Integration
- Explore embedding within a browser-based LLM interface
- Build Rust <-> WASM glue code to run compression/decompression client-side

---

### 📝 Notes
- All processing/encoding work will be done in **Rust**
- Human readability is **not** a concern — designed for machine interpretation

Sleep well 😴 — you’ve earned it. Let’s build something great.
