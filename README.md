# 🧠 ConC — A Symbolic Machine Language for LLMs

**ConC** (Conversation Compression for LLMs) is a symbolic language for compactly encoding and executing meaning inside language models. 
Originally a compression system, ConC has evolved into a **cognitive assembly language**; a way to express intent, tone, 
and semantics in 4-character symbolic words.

---

## 🚀 Vision: From Compression to Machine Code

ConC is a **compact symbolic instruction** that can guide LLM reasoning, modify tone or behavior, and encode semantic roles.

We’re building:
- ✅ A **universal symbolic format** for GPT-native thinking
- ✅ A **runtime pipeline** to decode and execute symbolic input
- ✅ A foundation for **LLM operating systems**, memory, and symbolic logic

---

## 🔤 ConC Word Structure

Each ConC word is exactly 4-Unicode characters:

    [base_word][presentation][tone]

#### Part Length Meaning
- _base_word_: 2-chars core meaning (e.g. "apple" → Ă훯)
- _presentation_: 1-char visual form (e.g. lowercase → Ā)
- _tone_: 1 char contextual/affective tone (e.g. neutral → Ā)

All characters are drawn from a curated GPT-safe Unicode set, optimized for token efficiency and directional safety.

### 🍎 Example:

The word "apple" with lowercase presentation and neutral tone is encoded as:

    Ă훯ĀĀ

This corresponds to the JSON entry:

``` json
{
"word": "apple",
"base_word": "Ă훯",
"presentation": "lowercase",
"base_presentation": "Ā",
"tone": "neutral",
"base_tone": "Ā"
}
```
Each ConC word is compact, symbolic, and designed for fast runtime decoding or execution.

## 🧱 Runtime Architecture

ConC’s runtime is designed using first principles and strict layer separation:

``` mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Input<br/>File / String / CLI]
    B[IOHandler<br/>Loads and emits data]
    C[DataTransport<br/>Internal stream/iterator control]
    D[DataSanitizer<br/>Filters & splits into valid ConC words]
    E[Decoder<br/>Pure word-to-meaning transformation]
    F[Logger<br/>Side-channel diagnostics]
    G[Output / Result / Error]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> G
    E --> F
```

Each layer is testable, replaceable, and symbolically pure.

# 🦇 Origin Story

ConC began with a wildly impractical but captivating idea:

“What if I could run a Dockerized Ollama server entirely client-side in my portfolio — using only WebAssembly?”

This led to late-night explorations of WASM, Linux compilation, v86, and how virtual machines actually run in the browser. The real challenge emerged when trying to load massive source trees like binutils into ChatGPT — only to hit token limits fast.

That’s when a question changed everything:

“What if I compressed all of this down into something that uses fewer tokens… but still means something?”

Thus ConC was born — not just as a compression tool, but as a symbolic machine language for encoding and executing meaning inside LLMs.

## 🙋 About

<<<<<<< HEAD
ConC.GPT is a symbolic language designed to compress and execute meaning inside large language models.
It began as a token-efficient format for compact input, and has grown into a structured system for symbolic reasoning and runtime execution.

This project explores what happens when words are treated not just as data, but as instructions.

Built with curiosity, Unicode, and a desire to make language models more expressive and controllable.
=======
This project was built by a human who didn’t want their LLM tokens to melt.

Built with defiance, Unicode, and an unhealthy obsession with symbol sets.
